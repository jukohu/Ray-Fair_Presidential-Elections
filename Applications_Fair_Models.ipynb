    "# Ray Fair — Econometrics and Presidential Elections: Two applicaitons\n",
    "\n",
    "The following jupyter notebook attempts to better understand Prof. Fair's work on forecasting elections (Fair, 1996, 2007) by appying his models and ideas to other elections. Fair's model is unique in the sense that it uses relitavely simple predictors (no fancy machine learning), which are macroeconomic in nature (no polling data, etc.). His model is known for its predictive power and therefore has served as an inspiration for this project. I am interested to what extend I can use his ideas in other contexts and what modifications different entities require. His model is very much tailored to the US electorial system and as you will see has limitations in other contexts. The model works quite well for the US due to it's bypartisan system and the presidents (assumed) power to affect macroeconomic indicators. \n",

    "I chose the first application out of relevance. The New York City Mayor Elections were coming up and I wanted to use Prof. Fair's model to explain election outcomes. It hoped that it would have help me to understand whether (national) economic indicators influence local voter behaviour. The main problem is the limitation of (historic) data. It became obvious that detailed data sets on local economic data for NYC are hard to find. \n",
    "I am aware of the limitations of my work and with more resources and further work, I could maybe have found better data or could have potentially predicted it. The imperfections of this project are obvious to me but that's not the point, I wanted to rather use this as good practice and a way to demonstrate my research skills while also better understanding Prof. Ray's work, which I find increasingly intriguing, also as I embark on my journey to find a specific research interest for my future academic career (seminars, senior thesis, Phd, etc.). In that sense, this project might be a starting point for either thinking about economic models for predicting local elections, a project on causally explaining voting behaviour (to what extend are voters influenced by federal policy in local elections) or the application of Prof. Fair's model to other countries, like my own, Germany. Next, I will apply the model with step by step applicaitons. \n",

    "First, I import data on NYC mayoral election outcomes, sourced from wikipedia. This data gives me a table with all the mayoral candidates, the voting year and their results. Inspired by Prof. Fair, I'll use the percentage for the democratic candidate as my dependent variable. One issue I encountered and should put more thought into is the problem of how independent candidates that are in between conservative and progressive might affect the model. In 1913 and 2009 an independent candidate won the election, which the model should account for. Otherwise, the New York City mayoral elections have a similar bypartisan structure or divide, which Prof. Fair's model also builds on. \n",

    "When I started this project, it was a reasonable assumption to me that federal economic data would not be a good predictor for local election data, since a New York City mayor usually has little power to influence macroeconomic policy, unless you are afraid of his power to influence wall street by closing down the metro or anyother reasonable hypothesis. Hence, I went on the search for local economic data that I believed to be much more relevant for local voter behaviour like local unemployment rates, income, etc.. Rent prices for example are usually subject of discussion in local election campaigns and affect many New Yorks. Additionally, mayors can to an extend actually through rent controls affect this economic indicator. Unfortunately, my search for local economic data was unsuccessful. While I did find much data on the FED of St. Luis website, I had to accept the limitation of historic quarterly data. This made it unfortunately impossible for me to use lcoal economic data, since I am reliant on historic data due to the small number of data points due to the 4 year gap. The FED of St. Louis actually offers local CPI and the Rent price index for new york, which dates back to 1914. However, because of the NA's the CPI data is only usable after 1945 and the rent data even later. Hence, I had to come to the conclusion that I might not be able to use local economic data effectively. Moreover, I didn't have any local income measure for G.\n",

    "Next, I am fitting the model. The first thing that concerns me is the low number of observations, which is only 21. That's why I have to be careful to not overfit by using too many predictors. I have a degree of freedom 18 for the residuals, which is enough to run OLS. However, I will respect the maximum of 3 predictors to not risk any overfitting. Moreover, to account for autocorrelation in my error-term I use HAC standard errors. In the following model, G_I and R_I plus a constant are my explanatory variables. Both coefficients are positive and statistically significant. However, I am concerned about omitted variable bias and quite a small adjusted R^2 of only 38.9 % of the variance explained, while also having had to omit three variables from Prof. Fair's model in order to not overfit.

    "Prof. Fair with his model predicts the percentage of the democratic candidate in the presedential elections. Since the US system is basically a two-party system, his choice of dependent variable proofs to work well to predict presedential election outcomes in the US. In contrast, Germany is a multi-party system and the chancellor gets elected by the governing coalition. Predicting coalitions is relatively hard because of the qualitative data it depends on but maybe we can use Prof. Fair's model to predict vote shares of specific parties. Another approach could be to ignore smaller parties and only focus on the christian democracts (conservatives) and the social democrats (progressives) as the two main forces in German politics. This was a reasonable assumption up until the 2010s when the German party system became more and more fragmented and the two dominating bipolar forces lost vote shares. To solve this, it could make sense to cluster parties in order to have two blocs and a bipolar system comparable to the US. An easier way that also builds upon the idea of Prof. Fair's model to look at how incumbent candidates or parties obtain credibility for their eocnomic policy, let's predict the governing party's vote share (i.e. the party that nominates the chancellor and the incumbent).\n",

    "Inflation doesn't seem to have a strong correlation with the vote share of the governing party, not even its lags. In contrast, GDP growth with one lag has a correlation of 0.669, which is not bad. Following these results, I'll include GDP growth lag 1 and not include the inflation rate. I will also add the variable DUR. Then, I do have a model with two predictors. I should not have any more due to the small number of observations and the risk of overfitting. "
